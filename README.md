Metamorphic JavaScript engine

An engine that is used to morph JavaScript code to evade detection techniques. JavaScript has some powerful obfuscation techniques that can used to change the signature of the program. 5 such techniques are implemented to do the same. 

Instructions:

Install Node.js and npm from the link below:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Check if node and npm is installed correctly: node -v, npm -v ( it should display a version number )

Open command prompt and go to your local directory.

-> npm install to install all the dependencies in package.json

-> npm start to run in local and morph away.

Some other useful commands:
Update npm
npm update -g

Build:
npm build

Run the application:
npm start

# Note: npm check is depricated. Remove that from the 'security check' in package.json and update 'start' accordingly.
